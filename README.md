### Hi, I'm Ivan ðŸ‘‹

Having worked as a developer for more than 20 years, I am passionate about exploring topics
such as Compilers, Data Science and Open Science. I have some knowledge in a variety of
programming languages such as Python, C++, JavaScript, PHP, VB, JAVA, Rust, ShellScript,
etc used for back-end, front-end, DevOps, and packaging. I had the chance to contribute to a
few scientific projects as a Research Software Engineer (RSE) for Transportation Engineering
and Public Health. 

Iâ€™ve contributed to open source projects such as PyTorch, ibis-framework,
and the Jupyter ecosystem, and Iâ€™ve created and been maintained some tools that helps to
improve the development workflow such as MakIm, and Containers-Sugar. 

Currently, I am also creating a compiler using LLVM (initially based on Kaleidoscope LLVM tutorial) that will support
Apache Arrow datatype as native types. Some of the libraries and tools Iâ€™ve used in the last years
are: LLVM, ibis-framework, pandas, PostgreSQL, Django, Django-rest framework, fastapi, flask,
GraphQL, Vue.js, JQuery, conda/conda-constructor/conda-build, Docker, mkdocs, and others. 

As an Open Science enthusiast, Iâ€™ve also recently contributed to PyOpenSci as a package reviewer,
review editor, and advisor, and I am leading a community called Open Science Labs, that aims to
create an open and safe space for learning, teaching and sharing knowledge, besides generating
opoortunities among the community and projects affiliated..
